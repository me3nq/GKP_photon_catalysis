# GKP_photon_catalysis
Series of Python codes written with the Jupyter Notebook to simulate photon catalysis and generate various non-Gaussian quantum states.  The results of this work are available on ArXiv in the paper "Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill state preparation by photon catalysis" arXiv:1903.01925v2. 

A brief discription of the codes can be found below:

Functions for Quantum Optics - defines and describes the different functions that are used to define different quantum states and the operations used in the simulations.
