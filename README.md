# GKP_photon_catalysis
Series of codes to simulate photon catalysis and generate various non-Gaussian quantum states. A brief discription of the codes can be found here:
Functions for Quantum Optics - defines and describes the different functions that are used to define different quantum states and the operations used in the simulations.
